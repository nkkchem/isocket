        <h1>Overview</h1>
        The Atlas of Coiled Coils is a fully automated, updated overview of extant coiled coils.
        <br>
        <br>
        Coiled coils are categorised using graph theory.
        <br>
        Each helix in the coiled coil is represented by a node.
        <br>
        Helices that interact via knob-into-hole interactions are joined by an edge.
        <br>
        This gives the graph of the coiled coil: those with the same graphs belong to the same category.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Details</h1>
        The classification is implemented in Python.
        <br>
        For identifying coiled coils,
        we use the ISAMBARD (Intelligent System for Analysis, Model Building And Rational Design)
        Python package developed in the Woolfson group.

        <br>
        The SOCKET cutoff (<i>scut</i>):
        <br>
        The maximum distance between the centre of mass of a knob residue and those for each of the hole residues
        <br>
        <br>
        The knob cutoff (<i>kcut</i>):
        <br>
        There must be more than <i>kcut</i> knob-into-hole interactions between each pair of helices defined to be interacting.
